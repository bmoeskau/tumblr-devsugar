# Tumblr Dev Sugar

Simple Tumblr theme mods for devs, primarily adding [SyntaxHighlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/) support.

## Usage

The various included mods are simply mix-n-match includes and code snippets that I use with my Tumblr themes. They are intended to be added directly into a Tumblr theme via the `Customize > Theme` menu. Some are general-purpose and some are theme-specific, and the details are included with each mod.

## Contribute

Have an idea for improvement? Please fork the repo and send me a pull request. Ideas welcome!
